# Hi ! 👋 I'm Alberto Luis

## And this is my GitHub, where I share my projects to the world. 
While studying sociology, I wanted to research contemporary hot topics. However, due to their novelty, there was no _"classic"_ data available.

I discovered that by using code, **I could access a vast amount of data on various topics, enabling me to research what I was passionate about**.

Despite not having a coding background, I taught myself by reading others' GitHub pages, understanding their code, and adapting it to access the data I needed.

Now, I want to create a GitHub page that would have helped my past self and anyone interested in conducting similar analyses.

**Feel free to contact me if you have doubts, ideas or projects throught:**
